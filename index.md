{:.definition}
A set $C$ is *convex* if for all $x, y ∈ C$ and $α ∈ [0,1]$ the point $α x + (1-α) y ∈ C$.

{:.theorem}
There are no natural numbers $ℕ = (1, 2, 3, ...)$ $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that 
$x^n + y^n = z^n$, in which $n$ is a natural number greater than 2.

{:.proof} 
There are no natural numbers $ℕ = (1, 2, 3, ...)$ $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that 
$x^n + y^n = z^n$, in which $n$ is a natural number greater than 2.
